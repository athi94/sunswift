This is the default sunswift Google Code mercurial repository.

Be warned: this repository contains many project subrepositories, which
themselves contain subrepositories of common stuff, such as libaltium and
scandal.

Cloning this main repository will clone each of the subrepositories and
their children as well. Hence you will get many copies of scandal and
libaltium inside the project directories. You may or may not want this.

Cloning this top-level repository is only usually done by people who are
maintaining the repositories and who know how mercurial subrepositories
work. It can be confusing. Be careful.

If you are just looking around, I suggest that you clone an individual project
subrepository.
